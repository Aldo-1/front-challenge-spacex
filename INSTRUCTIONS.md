## How did you decide which technologies to use as part of your solution?

I decide to use this technologies, because helped in my development progress, the typescript for the type of variables,every time help a lot, the storybook to preview the components, next js to do a static website and the jest to test my program.

## Are there any improvements you could make to your submission

I dont think so, only in the part of graphQl. Because i used a simple lib called GraphQL Client. I could used Apollo Client.

## What would you do differently if you were allocated more time

Used apollo client.
